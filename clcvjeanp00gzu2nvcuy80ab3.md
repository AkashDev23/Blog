It's hard to believe that another year has come and gone, and as I sit down to reflect on 2022, I am filled with a mix of emotions. For me, It's been a year of discovery and learning as I've taken my first steps into the world of coding.

Perhaps one of the biggest challenges I faced, in the beginning, was understanding the basics of programming concepts such as data types, loops, and logic. It can be overwhelming to try and make sense of it all, but I've stuck with it, watching tutorials, reading documentation, and experimenting with different coding examples. üò£

I wasted a lot of my time finding quality resources to help me learn but at this moment I came across the Java dsa playlist by Kunal Kushwaha and it helped me a lot in clearing my concepts in a very easy way.üòä

Once while I was watching youtube a developer suggested that *if we want to learn anything then we have to do projects in that particular technology.* So, I've worked on small projects like building a simple calculator and a to-do listüìÉ application, which have helped me to understand the fundamental concepts of programming. And as I've gained more experience, I've started to feel more confident in my ability to solve problems and write code.üßë‚Äçüíª

After This, I made my Linkedin and Twitter profiles and started sharing what I am doing. I saw a post shared by a developer where he talked about hacktoberfest and when I pinged him he guided me more about it. I learned git and Git Hub and made 4 successful prs this October. Learning in public and contributing to open source is not only fun but also helped me to build my problem-solving skills and understand how things worked in the real world.

One of the highlights of the year was when I added a function in an open-source project that actually worked as I expected and I felt a sense of satisfaction. I've likely realized that programming is not as difficult as it seems and that it's all about breaking down problems and finding solutions.üòå

It's true that I still have a lot to learn, and the road ahead can seem long and winding. However, looking back on all the progress I've made in the last year, I can see that I have come a long way in a relatively short time, and I am well on my way to becoming a skilled programmer.

At the end of the year, I got a chance to attend my first in-person tech event Devfest Bhubaneshwar.

As the new year approaches. I'm eager to continue learning and expanding my skills. take this opportunity to set some goals for me, whether it's learning a new programming language or contributing to open-source projects. and most importantly, don't be afraid to make mistakes, because that's how you learn and improve.

In summary, I can say that the year 2022 has been a wonderful journey of learning, building and making mistakes. With the year coming to an end, I can look back on my progress with pride and excitement for what's to come in the future.‚ù§Ô∏è
