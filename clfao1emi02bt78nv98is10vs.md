I got the idea of writing this blog when I suggest one of my friends start blogging and his answer was very shocking. he said, "Chat GPT is not working right now, I'll start writing when chat GPT works fine again." üò®This was literally my reaction.

Are you also like this?ü§î

# Introduction

I have been using ChatGPT a lot since its release and I must say it is a boon for everyone out there. It has been trained over a lot of data which you can use to get information about almost anything. You can generate codes, paragraphs, articles, etc. That too with very less or no errors. But as we know everything comes with a drawback and nothing's perfect and if something seems perfect then it certainly has a very big problem and the thing is it isn't visible yet.

AI tools can be very useful in streamlining certain aspects of the writing process, but they cannot entirely replace human creativity, intuition, and expertise. There are a lot of limitations to their ability to produce high-quality content that resonates with the readers.

# Problem with using AI

## Lacks CreativityüñºÔ∏è

So much research and development are done in the field of AI ML so that the work of humans can be reduced. If a model is trained on certain data it can only produce results based on that data It can't generate anything new. AI can do all those things that are repetitive. So humans can spend more time on creative things. But it is happening the opposite.

AI can generate grammatically correct sentences, but it lacks the emotional intelligence required to create the best content. A human writer can give his unique perspective which may or may not be repetitive but it will be unique and from his brain. Like I'm giving here in this blogüòÅ. He can use humor and connect with readers in a better way.

## No Personalityü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A blog is a reflection of a brand. My blog represents me. I have my own voice and writing style which I use in my blog which is very different from anyone. In the case of humans, the personality usually increases with time as we write more and it also has a uniqueness, which AI may not be able to mimic. AI-generated content lacks the personality and tone that we want to convey to our readers.

Sentences written by a human may be correct or incorrect but it's the way the writer communicates in his daily life whereas in the case of AI, it makes everything in a pattern and it suggests the best result. Many times we use phrases that AI don't know but we use them in our daily sentences. AI fails there.

## Danger of plagiarismüíÄ

Since AI is trained over a huge number of data there is a possibility that it may use content from existing sources to generate new content. Which can raise concerns about plagiarism. It could be a problem for you if your blog violates copyright laws and even if it doesn't It makes no sense to upload the same content again which is already there just by changing the words.

## Limited knowledge

If we want to write about an incident that happened after the AI was released then AI will not have a complete understanding of the context surrounding it. As a result, it lacks accuracy, relevance, and context, which can lead to confusion and misinformation. Blogs generated by AI falls in providing a complete understanding of real-world events that are constantly evolving making the content less reliable. You can try doing your assignments with AI you will understand what I am trying to say.

# Conclusion

Blogs aren't just some random texts that are a little bit relevant to the topic and make sense to the reader. Blogs are something where writers share their thoughts, experiences and opinions on topics. And for the reader blogs can be an excellent source of information, entertainment or inspiration. And in any case, someone won't expect reading something irrelevant or repetitive.

While AI-generated texts can be useful in certain situations, they currently lack the creativity, empathy, and that personal touch that human writers bring to their content. **So please think twice before using AI for making it write your blog**.

# My take

If you are a blogger or planning to start a blog, do it right now don't think of grammatical errors or something like that. Your writing skill will improve eventually and for the errors, there are many free online tools that you can use.

Use your creativity and skills to generate content than solely relying on AI. **Let's not forget blogs are an excellent way to share our thoughts and experiences, and we should embrace the power of human creativity.**
