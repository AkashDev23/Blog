I understand what you may be thinking - a few days ago, I advised against using AI to write a blog post, but now I am recommending it. Am I a hypocrite? No, hold on. There's more to the story. Please read the full blog post to learn why I changed my opinion.

# Hashnode

Before talking about Hashnode's AI, it is important for me as your responsible friend to first tell you what Hashnode is. Hashnode is a modern blogging platform that is known for its bloggers, who are mostly developers from around the globe. They share their technical knowledge and experiences with a like-minded community. The platform offers an easy-to-use and customizable blogging experience where developers can publish articles, tutorials, code snippets, and more.

# Why AI?

In my previous blog, I mentioned not to use AI (I hope you have read it; if not, you can read it here). Although I presented some points, my main argument was that using AI kills creativity, and I am not neglecting what I said before. I explained the negative aspects of AI, but there is a positive way to use AI without harming your blog. Here are a few ways in which AI can be helpful for bloggers.

* Improved writing quality: Since most of the readers of my blog are from places where English is not the first language, using AI tools can help improve grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. Additionally, AI tools can catch errors that you may have missed during the writing process.
    
* Faster Content Creation and Increased Reach and Engagement: AI can help you optimize your content for search engines by suggesting keywords and outlining your article. In some cases, it can even write parts of the article for you. This can save time and increase the reach and engagement of your content.
    

# Hashnode's AI

In its latest update, Hashnode has added AI to the platform. As a daily user of the platform, I have observed that it uses AI in many ways to improve the user experience for both bloggers and readers. Here are a few examples:

* ü§ñHashnode's AI automatically suggests relevant tags based on the content of your blog. This saves a lot of time and helps ensure that your posts are seen by the right people in the right places.
    
* üìàIt analyzes a user's reading history and behavior to suggest relevant articles and blogs that they might be interested in. This helps readers discover new content that is based on their interests.
    
* üë•Hashnode's AI is capable of analyzing comments and feedback to determine the sentiment of the audience. This helps bloggers get a better understanding of how their posts are being received and make adjustments as needed.
    

Any good thing isn't free, and everything comes with a cost. Therefore, to use most of the features of Hashnode's AI, you have to buy a pro subscription. The pro subscription unlocks premium features such as custom domains, SEO optimization, and analytics, in addition to AI-powered tools that help bloggers improve their writing skills, generate ideas for new blog posts, and increase their reach and engagement.

While the basic features of Hashnode are free, the pro subscription offers additional benefits that can take your blogging game to the next level. However, it's important to note that the pro subscription is optional, and bloggers can still use Hashnode's basic features to publish and share their content for free.

# Hashnode Pro

Hashnode's pro features that enhance the blogging experience and benefit bloggers in terms of monetization and exposure are:

1. üîó**Custom Domain**: With a Hashnode Pro account, you can connect your custom domain to your blog. This gives you a professional look and better branding since readers see your blog's domain name instead of Hashnode's subdomain. Using a custom domain also helps you establish your own online presence and build trust with your audience.
    
2. üìà**Advanced Analytics**: With Hashnode Pro, you get access to advanced blog analytics that give you insights into your blog's traffic and engagement metrics. You can see which posts are performing better and monitor your blog's audience growth over time. This helps you make data-driven decisions and optimize your content strategy accordingly.
    
3. üö´**Ad-Free Experience**: Hashnode Pro enables you to use your own ad network or leave your blog ad-free. This is a major benefit to bloggers as it allows them to monetize their blogs effectively without depending on any third-party platforms or being bogged down by intrusive ads.
    
4. üìß**Newsletter Integration**: One of the biggest benefits of Hashnode Pro is that it allows you to integrate your blog with email marketing platforms like Mailchimp or ConvertKit. This means that you can send newsletters to your subscribers directly from your Hashnode dashboard, keeping your audience up-to-date with your latest content and growing your mailing list.
    
5. üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶**Multi-Author Support**: If you work as part of a team or invite guest bloggers to your platform frequently, Hashnode Pro's multi-author feature is incredibly useful. You can add multiple authors to your blog with different levels of access, which means collaborators can add, edit or remove content with ease.
    

In terms of monetization, using a custom domain and direct advertising helps bloggers carve their own niche in their target market while effectively communicating their brand message. With advanced analytics, custom domain and multi-author support, bloggers can build a community around their blog and drive organic traffic to their website, increasing their exposure and potential for revenue. Overall, Hashnode Pro features provide bloggers with the tools and resources that they need to build a successful blog that stands out from the crowd.

***Don't have money? Don't worry. It has something for free also.***

# RIX

Rix is a chatbot developed by Hashnode that is designed to assist developers, tech enthusiasts, and individuals who are curious about programming. It's really cool, and I personally use it a lot(more than chat gpt), not only for blogging but also for exploring different aspects of technology. Rix has some really cool features for all tech enthusiasts. Some of it's features that I like the most are:

* It provides a wide range of programming languages including JS, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, and many more.
    
* Rix can also provide code examples in markdown format along with the language indication. This is really helpful for people who are learning to code. üßë‚Äçüíª
    
* Rix has a vast knowledge base that includes information about programming concepts, frameworks, tools and technologies that are currently popular in the industry. üß†
    
* Rix can provide personalized assistance by asking you questions to understand your requirements and providing relevant information and resources to help solve your problem. ü§ñ
    
* Its best part which makes it unique from other chatbots is its accessibility. It is available 24/7 and helps you with your queries at any time. ‚è∞
    

I personally use Rix to generate outlines for my blog, but you can use it for anything. In addition to the general chatbot, it also has specific chatbots for Flutter, React Native, Tailwind, and more. Best of all, you can use all of these features for free.
