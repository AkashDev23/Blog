Learning Data Structures and Algorithms takes a lot of time, and at the same time, wanting green dots on your GitHub can be overwhelming at times. So today, in this blog, I'll be sharing with you a cool trick by which you can do both at the same time.

You may have a question in your mind: "I am not developing anything, so what will I push on my GitHub?"ü§î

Although you may not be developing anything, you can still solve questions and push your solutions on GitHub. It is still better than doing nothing.

To do this there's a very cool chrome extension named [LeetHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi).

## What's LeetHub?

LeetHub, a Chrome extension, streamlines the process of pushing your code to GitHub whenever you successfully submit a problem on platforms like LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks. With over 30K developers worldwide, LeetHub has been utilized more than 30 million times to enhance the coding experience and productivity of its users.

## How to use it

To use LeetHub, simply search for it in your browser and install the extension. Once installed, an icon similar to this will appear on the toolbar of your web browser.

LeetHub will prompt you to authenticate it with your GitHub account. After authentication, a repository similar to this will be created in your GitHub account.

From there, all you have to do is submit questions correctly, and the corresponding code will automatically be added to your GitHub repository. By clicking on the LeetHub icon, you can also see how many questions you have solved. Currently, I've solved three questions, and it's reflecting the same here.
