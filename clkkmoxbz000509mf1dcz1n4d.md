Welcome dear readers👋In today's blog I'll be sharing with you some of my most cherished accomplishments, lessons learned, and the personal growth I've experienced along the way in 2023. I hope that this article inspires you to reflect on your own achievement.

Before getting into my accomplishments of this year, It's important for you to know my past. Everyone has a different past and your past defines your present and how in future you will perform.

## My past

I am a 20-year-old currently in my third year of a computer science undergraduate program. Unlike being highly studious, I enjoy exploring multiple interests. Rather than subscribing to the notion of being a "master of none," I believe it's better to be proficient (an 8) in four areas than an expert (a 10) in just one. For me, personal growth comes from evolving in various aspects of life.

Before college, I was an average guy with interests in painting, playing guitar, and running, but computer science wasn't among them. However, circumstances and my parents' wishes led me to choose this field. After enrolling in college in November 2021, I initially struggled to grasp the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) while my peers excelled in building projects and earning certificates.

Realizing the benefits of being active on social media, I created my LinkedIn profile to showcase my work. Then, in October 2022, my second year commenced, bringing transformative experiences that shaped my journey. While I won't delve into the details here, I've shared a comprehensive recap of 2022 in an article [**\[link\]**](https://coolcoderr.hashnode.dev/developing-a-bluetooth-low-energy-based-application)**.**

Now let's talk about the main content of this blog.

## 2023

### My First event

During my third semester, I was actively engaged as an Android developer for a startup project. In January, an exciting opportunity presented itself when I got the chance to showcase our startup at "Startup Odisha," a competition gathering participants from all over the state. Though it was my first experience in such a competitive setting, I embraced the moment with a mix of excitement and nerves.

While I didn't secure the top spot, the experience proved to be incredibly valuable. The event provided a platform to connect with like-minded individuals who shared the same passion for entrepreneurship and innovation. One of the highlights was discussing our project with the esteemed Minister of the Department of Energy, Mr. Pratap Keshari Deb. My primary objective was to build a robust network, and in that aspect, I considered the event a success.

Moreover, participating in "Startup Odisha" unexpectedly brought attention to our project. Prominent newspapers like the [*Times of India*](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/maiden-startup-fair-begins-in-bhubaneswar-for-youth-entrepreneurs/articleshow/97016431.cms)*,* [*Odisha Bytes,*](https://odishabytes.com/startup-mela-odisha-to-generate-rs-40000-cr-revenue-from-mio-intents-says-minister/) and local news outlets featured our participation and project.

`That's me in a blue shirt`

After this event, I got the chance to present my idea in front of people several more times. I want to mention that currently, I am not working on this idea anymore. At that time, I didn't know that I would not pursue this idea in the future, but the experience allowed me to make some awesome connections and provided numerous opportunities to speak, which significantly helped improve my communication skills. So, it was all worth it.

### First hackathon

`That's me with my team.`

After the event, I participated in a hackathon with a modified version of the same idea, but my interest started waning. The offline hackathon required staying awake for 48 hours, and despite achieving the runner-up position, I felt disheartened. The project involved hardware, which didn't captivate me, and I had to bear the load as my team lacked interest in that aspect. As a result, I lost my enthusiasm for the project, realizing I had invested an entire semester in something I eventually wanted to abandon. This feeling of wasted time further contributed to my declining interest.

## Research Intern

During that challenging time, I was battling deep feelings of depression when unexpectedly, a glimmer of hope emerged through an email from my college. The email presented an opportunity for a research internship with Samsung, which involved an online coding test. Despite my belief that I had squandered my semester and lacked sufficient preparation, I knew I couldn't pass up this chance. Determined, I dedicated myself to rigorous studying, and fortunately, I succeeded in clearing the test.

For a detailed account of my exam experience, you can find it in this blog [\[link\]](https://coolcoderr.hashnode.dev/my-first-coding-test).

Now, I am relishing my time at Samsung, especially as the work involves no hardware, which perfectly aligns with my interests. The presence of a supportive team and guiding mentors has further contributed to my enjoyment of this internship. Although primarily intended for third-year students, second-year students like me were also eligible to participate. Among the vast pool of over 4000 students, only 38 of us were selected, and I feel an immense sense of pride in being part of that exclusive group.

### G20

This is not just an achievement to boast about; instead, it's an invaluable experience that has contributed significantly to my personal growth. Throughout this journey, I have learned so much and had the privilege of meeting some of the brightest minds in India, forging meaningful personal connections along the way. The experience itself has been transformative, and I have documented all the details in my blog. If you're interested in delving deeper into this enriching experience, feel free to read it here [\[link\]](https://coolcoderr.hashnode.dev/my-g20-experience). I hope my reflections in the blog will not only provide insight into my journey but also inspire others to embrace opportunities and cherish the growth that comes with it.
