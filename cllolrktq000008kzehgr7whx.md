**Welcome**, dear readers, to my new blog. üåü I'm a third-year computer science undergraduate, and for almost a year now, I've been delving into tech-related topics across various platforms. In this article, I'll be sharing my personal experience, *insights*, and tips for anyone interested in writing about tech. So, without further ado, let's dive in! üöÄ

### My Journey in Tech Writing

I started writing blogs and tech-related articles almost a year ago. I have been doing these things for more than a year. I posted content on *Facebook* and *LinkedIn*, but I never had a blog and was never serious about it. I just shared whatever I read and liked. Currently, I've deleted my *Facebook* account, but you can still find me on [*LinkedIn*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-dev-274b05229/). In the beginning, I used to share handwritten content, but I realized that my handwriting was not up to par (*I realized this after receiving a comment* üòÖ). I started this endeavor during my second year of college when I was learning *Java*. If you have been following me, you might know how much I like *Java*. It could be because it was my first programming language or for various other reasons. That's a topic for another blog.

When I started, I shared the concepts I was learning, not necessarily limited to what I was studying in college, but from various sources. I have written on topics such as *Java*, *algorithms*, *software*, *core programming concepts*, and *object-oriented programming (OOP)*. I've also composed a series of articles on *computer architecture*, which you can read [here](https://dev.to/akashdev23/series/23701).

### Challenges

To mention, writing tech articles is not as easy as it seems. It involves some challenges. While these challenges are not insurmountable with determination, I'll mention these pitfalls so you can be aware. Some of these challenges include:

* Since this is not fiction but rather requires providing facts, and since facts are consistent everywhere, it becomes challenging to avoid *plagiarism*, *duplication*, and *outdated information*.
    
* *Technical writing* necessitates constant research, analysis, and creativity. It's not about just providing anything; the content must be *informative*, *relevant*, *accurate*, and *engaging*.
    
* *Technology* is a constantly evolving field. Staying current with the latest news, developments, and trends is essential. This won't be difficult if you are genuinely interested in this field. If this is not the case, then you'll need to put in some *hard work*. üí™

## Why Tech Writing is Cool‚ùÑÔ∏è

When I started writing, I didn't have many expectations. I simply wanted to share whatever I knew or was learning. And there's one more thing, though it wasn't my priority: improving my English. But to be honest, it helped me in many ways. I hope you've all heard about the Feynman Technique, which essentially states that explaining something to others enhances your understanding. This is precisely how it has helped me.

As I had to write articles and explain concepts to others, I had to delve into things in great detail. The process of reading extensively and delving deep into topics has significantly impacted my comprehension of the subjects I've covered. The more I know about something, the more I realize how little I know. This realization fuels my growing interest in these subjects. Attempting to teach others has fortified my knowledge and transformed me into a better learner.

Writing isn't solely about the act of writing itself. It's about infusing excitement into my tech journey. It propels me to continuously explore, learn, and share with others.üåè

### **The 'Aha' Moments That Sparked Growth**

My usual topics revolved around tech-related matters or whatever I happened to be learning at the time. It ranged from programming concepts to intricate algorithms. I enjoyed this process, but there was a time when my blog wasn't receiving a substantial number of views. The probable reason was that I was often sharing content that already existed on the internet, albeit rephrased. However, a pivotal moment arrived when I started sharing my learnings. During an event, I engaged with fellow tech enthusiasts and then translated those interactions into a blog post. The response was remarkable; the blog garnered significant attention.

This experience taught me that people are more intrigued by personal experiences. There's a profound resonance in your journey. When I explain a concept, I'm essentially rehashing information that's already available elsewhere online. It's about simplifying existing knowledge. Yet, when you share your journey, you're offering something unique to you. No one else could have undergone the same path as you did. Whether it's a positive revelation or a lesson from a mistake, your experience is distinctly yours. You can share it openly, adding value to the lives of your readers.

## **Looking Toward the Future**

A year has passed, and I can now confidently state that technical writing has extended its influence in numerous ways. It has polished my communication skills, bolstered my grasp of English, enriched my comprehension of concepts, and most notably, contributed to building my brand. Many people now recognize me thanks to my blog, and their appreciation has been humbling. Writing blogs truly sets you apart from the crowd. ‚ú®

### An Opportunity

Unexpectedly, something extraordinary happened. Since I shared my blogs on social media, I received a direct message from an individual who desired my writing skills for his business. He had read my articles and found them appealing. This led to a collaboration where I worked for him for almost three months, producing around 18 articles. He compensated me varying amounts, ranging from 500 to 800, for each article. This was an opportunity that I had never anticipated‚Äîa door that wouldn't have opened if I hadn't embarked on this journey in the first place.

## Why Everyone Should Consider Tech Writing?

Tech writing isn't just for tech experts‚Äîit's a tool that empowers everyone. It lets us turn complex jargon into clear stories, helping tech fans and beginners understand each other. üåê

Beyond personal benefits, tech writing helps our community grow. When I write, I'm part of a group sharing tech knowledge. Each article adds to our shared knowledge, thanks to many people sharing their different views. Just like I'm doing in this article. ü§ù

## Tips for Beginners

### Choosing Your Platform

There are many platforms out there for anyone to start, like LinkedIn, Blogger, Medium, Hashnode, etc. All of these platforms have their pros and cons. But for me, I'll recommend two platforms that I use the most: [Hashnode](https://coolcoderr.hashnode.dev/) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/akashdev23). I really love these platforms mainly because they have a good tech community, and moreover, these platforms are specific only towards tech, unlike other platforms. But, in the end, it doesn't matter where you write‚Äîpick what feels right for you.

### Keep It Going

Unlike any other thing, here consistency is the key. Writing regularly matters. Set a schedule that works for you and stick to it. Consistency builds your credibility. It makes people trust you and hence nurtures your following.

### Use Stories

Stories make your writing interesting. Relate your own experiences and real-life analogies in tech topics to make your content engaging. It keeps people engaged and helps you connect with them on a human level. That's all for today. I encourage you to start your blog now and share your articles in the comments below. I would love to read them.

## Conclusion

As I wrap up this article, I can't help but feel a sense of fulfillment in sharing my journey in tech writing with you. From the early days of casual shares to the meaningful connections forged through personal experiences, it's been a journey of growth, learning, and community-building. The world of tech is vast, constantly evolving, and full of opportunities to make your mark. Remember, your voice matters and your unique perspective adds depth to the ever-expanding realm of tech knowledge.
