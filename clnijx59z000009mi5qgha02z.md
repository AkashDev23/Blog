**C Programming Language: A Brief History**

*C programming language is quite popular among developers, especially beginners, but very few know why it is called "C".*

C is a general-purpose programming language created by **Dennis Ritchie** at the **Bell Laboratories** in **1972**.

The programming language is called "**C**" simply because it comes after an earlier programming language called "**B**."

The **B programming language**, developed by **Ken Thompson**, was a precursor to C and was used for various system-related tasks.

Dennis Ritchie wanted to improve and extend the B language, hence, he started working on a new language, which he initially referred to as "**New B**".

However, as the language evolved and gained popularity, it was eventually named "**C**." The name "C" is a tribute to the language's predecessor, B, as it follows the next letter in the alphabet.

C is a **procedural programming language**, which means it follows a structured programming approach, where a program is divided into functions or procedures.

The original development of C was closely tied to the creation of the **Unix** operating system, which was also developed at Bell Labs.
