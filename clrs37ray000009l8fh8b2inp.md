In simple terms, a **client** is someone who requests a service, and a **server** is someone who responds to that request. The server is basically a machine that provides some kind of service.

For example, if you want to add two numbers, you can send a request to a *calculator server*. The server will then add the two numbers and send the result back to you.

There are different types of servers, such as *file servers*, *email servers*, and *web servers*. **Web servers** are the most commonly used servers nowadays. They provide web pages, which are what you see when you visit a website.

*Client-server architecture* can be used to make a simple chat application. In a chat application, there is a server that all of the clients are connected to. When one client wants to send a message to another client, the message is sent to the server, and the server then sends the message to the other client.

## How a Client-Server Architecture Works with Multiple Clients

The speaker says that in a client-server architecture with multiple clients, the server acts as a central point of communication between the clients. When a client wants to send a message to another client, it sends the message to the server first. The server then routes the message to the other client. This way, the clients don't need to know the IP addresses of each other in order to communicate.

This architecture is more complex than a simple client-server architecture with only one client. In a multi-client architecture, the server needs to keep track of which clients are connected and how to route messages between them. This can be a challenge, but it is necessary if you want to have multiple clients communicating with each other.

## How a Client-Server Architecture Can Be Used to Make a Simple Chat Application

In a chat application, multiple clients (*users*) want to send messages to each other. In a client-server architecture, each client sends its message to the server, and the server then forwards that message to all the other clients. This way, all the clients can see all the messages that have been sent.

This approach can become complex when there are many clients. For example, if there are 100 clients, and each client sends a message to every other client, then the server will need to send 9900 messages (*100 \* 99*). This can quickly become overwhelming for the server.

To solve this problem, we can use a different architecture called a **publish-subscribe architecture**. In this architecture, clients don't send messages directly to each other. Instead, they send their messages to a central server called a **broker**. The broker then keeps track of which clients are interested in which topics, and it forwards messages to the appropriate clients. This way, the server only needs to send each message once, even if it needs to be sent to multiple clients.

## Limitations of Client-Server Architecture for Chat Applications with Multiple Clients

In a client-server architecture, each client sends its message to the server, and the server then forwards that message to all the other clients. This approach works well for simple chat applications with a few clients, but it can become inefficient and overwhelming for the server as the number of clients increases.

**Peer-to-peer architecture** addresses this issue by allowing clients to connect and communicate directly with each other, without going through a central server. This can significantly reduce the amount of traffic on the network and make the communication more efficient. However, peer-to-peer architectures can also be more complex to set up and manage than client-server architectures.

> The choice of which architecture to use will depend on the specific requirements of your application. If you have a small number of clients and don't need the features of a peer-to-peer architecture, then a client-server architecture may be sufficient. However, if you have a large number of clients or need the benefits of direct communication between clients, then a peer-to-peer architecture may be a better option.
