I wrote an article discussing the importance of women in tech, where I shared the Historical Perspective, highlighting how women have showcased their capabilities in this field throughout history. I also discussed the current landscape, including statistics and opportunities for women interested in entering the tech industry. If you haven't read that article yet, I recommend checking it out [here](article_link).

You can think of this blog post as a continuation of that article, although it's not. After writing the previous piece, I realized there's more to explore on this topic. So, let's delve into it.

## Challenges and Barriers

As we all know, we live in a male-dominated society, and gender bias stands out as one of the significant challenges women face, not only in tech but in almost every field. There are many stereotypes surrounding this issue. Many women feel they must work harder to combat these stereotypes and prejudices. Some of the most common challenges faced by women include:

### Income Inequality

Now, the biggest myth that persists is the belief that there is no gender-based pay disparity in tech. Sadly, people often find justifications for this. Some argue that differences in roles, working hours, skill sets, experience, or efficiency might lead to women being paid less than men. However, abundant research and studies show that women in the tech industry do face pay disparities compared to their male counterparts. You can read more about the research [here](https://hired.com/blog/highlights/hired-releases-annual-report-on-wage-gap-and-workplace-discrimination/).

### Fighting Stereotypes

This issue should have been resolved long ago, yet it persists. If a woman encounters stereotypes anywhere, it simply means we've failed as a society. Many people still perceive women as less technically proficient than men and more suited to non-technical or soft roles. Working mothers face additional challenges, including delayed promotion due to maternity leave, a lack of salary increases or bonuses because of pregnancy, and even the risk of being fired upon returning from maternity leave. Many women report feeling they must work harder to prove themselves or fight against stereotypes and prejudices.

[Nikita Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guptanikita16/) has shared her personal story of facing persistent questioning about her career choices from her family and society. You can watch her speech on [Josh Talks](https://youtu.be/3Bz5zjW5st0?si=3M9e_eCblCdG2hX_).

### Lack of Representation

The tech industry suffers from a significant lack of representation of women, making it daunting for women starting their careers to find role models. Often, they feel like they are the only woman in the room, with no one else to look up to. This lack of representation poses several challenges:

* Women may constantly feel the need to prove their competence and justify their presence, which can be exhausting and detrimental to their confidence.
    
* In meetings, they may feel pressured to represent all women in tech and act as spokespersons for their gender, which can be exceptionally taxing and distracting.
    
* Sometimes, they may experience isolation and a sense of not belonging, which can be very demotivating.
    

## How to Overcome These Challenges

These are just a few of the challenges women face, and as a community, we can help them by taking some simple steps. Here are a few things we can do:

* Build a support system for women, including mentors and coworkers.
    
* Negotiate your salary from the beginning.
    
* Join professional groups.
    
* Be vocal and advocate for yourself.
    
* Lastly, all men should acknowledge this issue, talk about it, and work towards resolving it.
    

## Success Stories

This section is for women who still feel demotivated and underconfident about their capabilities. Let's read some inspiring stories of women who have made significant contributions to the tech industry, overcoming challenges and achieving remarkable success:

**1\.** [**Reshma Saujani**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reshma-saujani/)**, Founder of Girls Who Code:** Reshma, an engineer and lawyer by training, identified a critical gap in STEM education for girls.
